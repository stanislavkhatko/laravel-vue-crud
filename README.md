# reads
The system will track users' book reading progress, and will reward readers with membership points based on lines they read, as well as for every minute spent reading. An admin dashboard will display a reports tab (SPA route admin/reports) with a users table. Admins will be able to query users based on criterias and filters selected. The filter can be applied to the users table and related tables.
